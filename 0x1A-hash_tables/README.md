0x1A-hash_tables

Python Dictionaries Python dictionaries are implemented using hash tables. When you will be done with this project, you will be able to better understand the power and simplicity of Python dictionaries. So much is actually happening when you type d = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}, but everything looks so simple for the user. Python doesnâ€™t use the exact same implementation than the one you will work on today though. If you are curious on how it works under the hood, there is a good blog post about how dictionaries are implemented in Python.

Note that all dictionaries are not implemented using hash tables and there is a difference between a dictionary and a hash table.

If you want to test for collisions, here are some strings that collide using the djb2 algorithm:

hetairas collides with mentioner

heliotropes collides with neurospora

depravement collides with serafins

stylist collides with subgenera

joyful collides with synaphea

redescribed collides with urites

dram collides with vivency
